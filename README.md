#  Jet Engine RUL Prediction

Predicting **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** for jet engines using NASA C-MAPSS data.

---

##  This is the Baseline Branch

This `main` branch contains the **initial version** of the project with basic ML models.

---

##  See the Full Development

 **[Switch to `experiment/improvements` branch](../../tree/experiment/improvements)** for:

-  LSTM Neural Network
-  Enhanced visualizations (dashboard + multi-engine plots)
-  More models (Ridge, improved comparisons)
-  Pretty console output
-  Full documentation

---

## Quick Switch

```bash
git checkout experiment/improvements
```

---

## Dataset

NASA C-MAPSS FD001  100 jet engines with sensor data, run to failure.

---

## Basic Usage

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
