# Jet Engine Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction

End-to-end predictive maintenance pipeline estimating Remaining Useful Life of jet engines using the NASA CMAPSS dataset.

## Project Goal
Build a clean, modular, and reproducible ML pipeline with proper software structure rather than a monolithic notebook.

## How to run

1. Download NASA CMAPSS FD001 dataset
2. Place files inside a `data/` folder
3. Install requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run

python main.py
